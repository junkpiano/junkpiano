# Development Tools

## Text Editor

### Visual Studio Code(Free)

As of 2021, VSCode is the king in text editor "industry". It's dominant in this market.
The reason is high advanced customizability as well as being free.

VScode fits any coding environments,and it is a universal app that can run anywhere.
I've been seeing a lot of people fail to refuse config-free/customizable text editor(VSCode) temptation.

Yes, I am writing this doc in VSCode.

### Sublime Text(\$80)

This is a lightweight but versatile text editor.
Sublime text is basically code editor but you can use this for writing plain text.

Sublime text supports multi platforms, windows, mac, linux.

### Atom(Free)

Sometimes I feel like getting IDE-like UX from text editor. In that way, Atom is my second choice.
Atom is desktop application on top of [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).

Vim is a free software. I've been trying to get along with Vim, but I cannot call Vim the best friend yet.

Xcode is the only one IDE for MacOS/iOS application development.

### Android Studio(Free)

When I do something for Android or Flutter, I am using Android Studio.
