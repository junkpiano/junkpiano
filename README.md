# Development Tools

## Text Editor

### Sublime Text(\$80)

This is a lightweight but versatile text editor.
Sublime text is basically code editor but you can use this for writing plain text.

Sublime text supports multi platforms, windows, mac, linux.

### Atom(Free)

Sometimes I feel like getting user experience from text editor. So Atom is my second choice.
Atom is desktop application, leveraged by web technology, as well as VSCode.

I used to VSCode in daily work, but I still don't like their UI so much. And I love atom's flexibility, which enables me to customize function by text based configuration.

Emacs is a free software. Emacs is my old friend.

#### Configuration

Xcode is the only one IDE for MacOS/iOS application development.

### Android Studio(Free)

When I do something for Android or Flutter, I am using Android Studio.
